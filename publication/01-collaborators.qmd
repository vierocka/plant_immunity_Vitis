## 2. Institutional Support

This work was supported by:

-   Mendel University in Brno (Project IGA-ZF/2023-SI1-015)
-   University of Cologne (Collaborative Research Center CRC1310 ‚Äì Predictability in Evolution)

## 3. Interactive Database

An accompanying interactive Shiny web application provides full access to the parsed and annotated transcriptomic results, enabling dynamic exploration of gene expression patterns, GO enrichment, and co-expression modules across Vitis vinifera genotypes and time points.

üîó Access the app: https://vierakovacova.shinyapps.io/playing_with_immunity/

The interface allows users to:

Search for individual genes or immunity-related modules

Visualize log‚ÇÇ fold-change trajectories across infection stages

Browse GO and Reactome enrichment results interactively

Export plots and tables for custom analyses

All datasets shown in the app are synchronized with this repository and are fully parseable for downstream analysis or integration into other bioinformatics workflows.
