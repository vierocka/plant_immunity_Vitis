This repository accompanies the study “Temporal coordination and network
integration of multilocus resistance in Vitis vinifera” and contains all
scripts, data, and figures used for analysis.

## 1. PTI & ETI Network Properties

| Genotype | n_nodes | n_edges | Density | Mean degree | Clustering | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Susceptible | 3553 | 635,423 | 0.101 | 357.7 | 0.712 | Sparse, weakly connected |
| Rpv12 | 3553 | 832,362 | 0.132 | 468.5 | 0.698 | Moderate ETI-centered connectivity |
| Rpv12+1 | 3553 | 837,230 | 0.133 | 471.3 | 0.724 | Reinforced PTI–ETI cross-talk |
| Rpv12+1+3 | 3553 | 344,794 | 0.055 | 194.1 | 0.592 | Global downscaling, reduced density |

Summary: Network density increased from the susceptible to Rpv12+1,
indicating strengthened regulatory connectivity with locus stacking. In
Rpv12+1+3, network density decreased markedly, reflecting
transcriptional downregulation and system stabilization rather than
further activation.

## 2. Aggregated Expression Divergence (AED)

| Genotype | 0 hpi (FDR) | 6 hpi (FDR) | 24 hpi (FDR) | Interpretation |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Susceptible | — | — | — | Reference baseline |
| Rpv12 | 0.0045 (\*\*\*) | 0.028 (\*\*) | 0.042 (\*) | Rapid early divergence, moderate persistence |
| Rpv12+1 | 0.0052 (\*\*\*) | 0.013 (\*\*) | 0.015 (\*\*) | Stabilized early defense |
| Rpv12+1+3 | 0.0007 (\*\*\*) | 0.008 (\*\*\*) | 0.061 (ns) | Transient burst and re-stabilization |

Summary: AED confirms the strongest early (0–6 hpi) transcriptomic
divergence in Rpv12 and Rpv12+1, followed by partial stabilization in
Rpv12+1+3, consistent with regulatory compensation across loci.

### 3. GLM Models of DEG Counts

| Effect Tested | χ² | df | p-value | Direction | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------------------|
| Genotype | 18.6 | 3 | 0.0003 | — | Strong effect of resistance background |
| Time (0–6–24 hpi) | 24.7 | 2 | 0.00001 | ↓ over time | Fewer DEGs at later stages |
| Direction (Up vs Down) | 9.2 | 1 | 0.002 | Down \> Up | Repression dominates late responses |
| Genotype × Time | 7.1 | 6 | 0.312 | — | Interaction not significant |

Summary: Overall transcriptional activation peaks early and declines
over time. Rpv12+1 shows the most balanced up/down regulation, while
Rpv12+1+3 displays overall downregulation compatible with late
suppression or feedback control.

### 4. Immunity-Class Expression Dynamics

| Immunity Class | Genotype  | 0 hpi | 6 hpi | 24 hpi | Trend                          |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| ETI_specific   | Rpv12     | +0.25 | +0.04 | 0.00   | Early ETI burst                |
| ETI_specific   | Rpv12+1   | +0.14 | −0.04 | −0.20  | Decline after early activation |
| ETI_specific   | Rpv12+1+3 | −0.11 | −0.12 | −0.21  | Persistent downregulation      |
| PTI_specific   | Rpv12     | +0.13 | −0.01 | +0.09  | Weak late activation           |
| PTI_specific   | Rpv12+1   | −0.02 | +0.01 | −0.04  | Transient                      |
| PTI_specific   | Rpv12+1+3 | −0.04 | −0.16 | −0.10  | Inhibited signaling            |
| PTI_ETI_shared | Rpv12     | +0.26 | +0.07 | −0.20  | Early–late inversion           |
| PTI_ETI_shared | Rpv12+1   | +0.31 | +0.11 | −0.17  | Strong early synergy           |
| PTI_ETI_shared | Rpv12+1+3 | −0.02 | −0.05 | −0.06  | Flattened response             |

Summary: Early ETI activation dominates in Rpv12, while Rpv12+1 exhibits
strong PTI–ETI synergy at 0 hpi. Rpv12+1+3 shows general transcriptional
repression, consistent with regulatory saturation and reduced network
density.

### 5. Interpretive Summary

-   PTI–ETI integration peaks in Rpv12+1, representing maximal
    cross-layer reinforcement.
-   Rpv12+1+3 shows strong signal compression, suggesting network
    stabilization or feedback inhibition.
-   Temporal analysis indicates that defense waves shift from early ETI
    bursts (Rpv12) toward integrated PTI/ETI signaling (Rpv12+1) and
    then global damping (Rpv12+1+3).

These trends are consistent with aggregated divergence and network
metrics, implying that multilocus resistance enhances robustness not by
continuous activation but by regulatory balance.
