Methods Overview

1.  Plant Material and Experimental Design

Three *Vitis vinifera*–based genotypes carrying different combinations of resistance loci (Rpv12, Rpv12+1, Rpv12+1+3) and a susceptible control were propagated under controlled conditions.
Leaves were inoculated with *Plasmopara viticola* sporangia (50,000 spores mL⁻¹).
Samples were collected at 0, 6, and 24 hours post-inoculation (hpi), each with three biological replicates (36 total libraries).

2.  RNA Isolation and Sequencing

Total RNA was extracted using the Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich).
RNA integrity was confirmed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer.
Sequencing libraries were prepared by Novogene (UK) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq platform (150 bp paired-end).

3.  Quality Control and Read Mapping

Reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic (v0.39) and quality-checked using FastQC (v0.11.9) (Trimming_mapping/QualityChecks_Trimming_mapping.sh).
Clean reads were mapped to the Vitis vinifera PN40024 v4 reference genome using STAR (v2.7.4a).
Gene-level counts were quantified with featureCounts from the subread package.

4.  Data Normalization and Batch Correction

Raw count matrices were normalized by DESeq2 and log-transformed (Batch_effects/bacth_effects.R).
Batch effects were detected and corrected using ComBat from the sva package (Batch_effects/bacth_effects.R and Batch_effects/read_checks.R and DGEA/Heteroscedasticity.R).
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) verified clustering by genotype and time, not sequencing batch.

5.  Differential Expression Analysis (DGEA)

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified per genotype and time point (DGEA/DGEA.R).
Statistical thresholds: \|log₂FoldChange\| \> 1, FDR \< 0.05.
Functional enrichment (GO, Reactome, UniProt keywords) was performed using the STRINGdb API.

6.  Gene Categorization and Pattern Classification

Each gene’s temporal pattern was classified into six expression types (IEV, ER, TRS, LR, SCh, CPs) based on up/down regulation across time.
Comparisons across genotypes defined shared, recovered, and genotype-specific categories (Groups I–VI).

7.  Aggregated Expression Divergence (AED)

Transcriptomic divergence relative to the susceptible reference was computed using the mean squared difference of normalized counts (AED_analysis/DGE_bySFandCB_divergence.R).
Empirical null distributions were generated by permutation to assess statistical significance (FDR correction).
AED quantifies overall expression distance and system stabilization per genotype and time.

8.  Co-expression Network Analysis (GCNA)

Pairwise Pearson correlations were computed across 26,000 expressed genes (GCNA/GCNA_network_analysis.R).
Edges above the 99.5th percentile (r \> 0.817) defined the adjacency network.
Modules were detected using hierarchical clustering, and eigengenes correlated with genotype-time patterns.
Network topology metrics (density, clustering coefficient) were calculated with igraph.

9.  PTI/ETI Gene Classification and Cross-Talk

Homology mapping linked Arabidopsis thaliana immunity genes to Vitis orthologs (data_files/Vitis_gene_immunity_class.csv).
Genes were categorized as ETI-specific, PTI-specific, or PTI–ETI shared (GCNA/create_immunity_classes.R).
Their log₂FC dynamics were visualized via clustered heatmaps (GCNA/GCNA_network_analysis.R), revealing time-resolved activation of immunity layers.

10. Statistical Modeling and Visualization

Generalized linear models (quasi-Poisson link) tested effects of genotype, time, and direction on DEG counts (transcriptional_dynamics/DEGs_counts_global_tests.R).
Pairwise contrasts were evaluated by emmeans with FDR correction.
Figures were generated in ggplot2 and pheatmap.
All analyses were performed in R 4.3.2 and documented in the public repository: 👉 https://github.com/vierocka/plant_immunity_Vitis
