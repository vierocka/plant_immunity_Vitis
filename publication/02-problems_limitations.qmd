## Problem Definition

Plant immune responses rely on two interconnected recognition systems:

-   Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) — initiated by cell-surface
    receptors detecting conserved microbial features, and
-   Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) — mediated by intracellular NLR
    receptors detecting pathogen effectors.

In Arabidopsis thaliana and other model species, these two layers are
known to act sequentially and synergistically, generating temporal
“waves” of defense activation. However, in long-lived crops such as
grapevine (Vitis vinifera), the molecular integration of PTI and ETI
under natural multilocus resistance remains largely unknown.

Classical breeding has introduced multiple Rpv loci (e.g., Rpv12, Rpv1,
Rpv3) from wild relatives into cultivated V. vinifera backgrounds. While
these loci confer durable resistance to Plasmopara viticola, it is
unclear how their combined introgression reshapes genome-wide
transcriptional dynamics and whether multi-locus resistance strengthens
defense by additive activation, by stabilization of signaling, or by
regulatory redundancy.

Thus, the central problem addressed in this study is:

**How does the introgression of multiple resistance loci alter the
structure, timing, and coordination of immune gene expression networks
in grapevine?**

We tackle this question by integrating:

-   differential expression and aggregated divergence analyses
-   generalized linear modeling of immune activation intensity
-   co-expression network reconstruction
-   PTI/ETI gene classification based on Arabidopsis homology

This approach bridges the gap between single-locus studies and
systems-level understanding of multilayered plant immunity, revealing
how polygenic resistance can rewire defense timing and network
organization to achieve robust pathogen control.

## Limitations

Although our study provides a comprehensive transcriptomic and
network-level view of multilocus resistance in *Vitis vinifera*, several
caveats should be acknowledged:

-   Non-isogenic genetic backgrounds The resistant lines (Rpv12,
    Rpv12+1, and Rpv12+1+3) are not fully isogenic with the susceptible
    reference. Each line represents decades of breeding and
    backcrossing; hence, background genomic variation unrelated to
    resistance loci may influence expression profiles. Our design
    minimizes this effect by focusing on conserved early and
    defense-related transcriptional modules, but residual genetic
    heterogeneity cannot be excluded.

-   Comparative reference limitation All differential expression
    contrasts are computed against a single susceptible reference
    genotype, which defines “zero” DEGs by construction. While this
    enables a direct assessment of resistance-associated activation, it
    prevents estimation of absolute transcriptional baselines for each
    genotype.

-   Homology-based PTI/ETI classification The PTI- and ETI-related gene
    groups were inferred from Arabidopsis thaliana homologs and existing
    immunity annotations. Because immune receptor repertoires and
    downstream signaling components are only partially conserved between
    Arabidopsis and Vitis, these classifications should be interpreted
    as functional analogies, not strict orthologies.

-   Lack of genomic sequence validation DNA resequencing was not
    performed, and the precise introgressed segments were inferred from
    known Rpv locus coordinates. As such, we cannot quantify
    recombination boundaries or confirm the absence of additional linked
    loci.

-   Temporal and tissue resolution The present dataset captures three
    discrete infection time points (0, 6, and 24 hpi) in leaf tissue.
    Intermediate signaling events and cell-type–specific dynamics (e.g.,
    epidermal versus mesophyll responses) remain unresolved and could
    refine the temporal model of layered immunity.

-   Functional inference from transcriptional data Network density,
    clustering, and aggregated divergence are correlative measures of
    regulatory coordination, not direct evidence of causal gene–gene
    interactions. Integrating phosphoproteomics or metabolite data in
    future work will be necessary to validate inferred regulatory
    stabilization.

### Summary Statement

Taken together, these limitations do not undermine the main conclusions
— that multilocus introgression reshapes the timing and coordination of
immune responses — but they delineate the scope of inference to
transcriptomic-level regulatory organization rather than direct genetic
or mechanistic causality.
