# The Problem

```{=html}
<!--
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this
proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up
for the next section - the proposed solution!

It is important to cover:

 - [ ] What the problem is
 - [ ] Who it affects
 - [ ] Why is it a problem
 - [ ] What will solving the problem enable (why should it be solved)
 - [ ] Brief summary of existing work and previous attempts (e.g., relevant R packages)
 - [ ] If proposing changes to R itself: letter of support from R Core member
-->
